# 90‑Day Growth Plan for ActionNote

This plan outlines how ActionNote can grow from zero to 1 000 users within three months using a combination of waitlist marketing, beta testing, public launches and referral loops.

## Phase 1: Waitlist build (Days 1–15)

* **Landing page + social media:** Launch the actionnote.io landing page with a clear value proposition and waitlist form.  Share the page across your network (LinkedIn, Twitter, relevant Slack communities).  Encourage signups by teasing upcoming features.
* **Content marketing:** Publish a blog post or LinkedIn article discussing the pain of manual meeting notes and how AI summarisation can help.  Share snippets on social platforms with a link to the waitlist.
* **Cold outreach:** Identify target communities (remote workers, project managers, product teams) and invite them to join the waitlist.  Use personal messages rather than spam.
* **Goal:** Collect 100–200 waitlist signups by day 15.

## Phase 2: Beta testing (Days 16–45)

* **Invite early adopters:** Send beta invites to the first 50 people on the waitlist.  Provide them with free unlimited access in exchange for feedback.
* **Customer feedback loop:** Set up weekly check‑ins with beta users.  Collect feedback on usability, summarisation quality and missing features.  Rapidly iterate to address common pain points.
* **Referral incentive:** Encourage beta users to refer colleagues by offering them additional free months for each successful referral.
* **Community building:** Create a private Slack or Discord community for beta users to share experiences and tips.  Actively participate to build rapport.
* **Goal:** Achieve 20–30 active weekly users by the end of the beta period and collect testimonials.

## Phase 3: Public launch (Days 46–70)

* **Product Hunt launch:** Prepare a polished Product Hunt listing with screenshots, a demo video (use the TikTok script as a base) and testimonials from beta users.  Schedule launch for maximum visibility (Tuesday or Wednesday morning PST).  Engage in comments and encourage supporters to upvote.
* **Indie Hackers & Reddit posts:** Share a transparent launch story on IndieHackers and relevant subreddits (#SaaS, #AI, #productivity).  Focus on the pain point and show how ActionNote solves it.  Answer questions promptly.
* **Email blast:** Send a launch announcement to the entire waitlist with a clear call‑to‑action to create a free account.
* **Partnership outreach:** Reach out to productivity blogs and newsletters for reviews or mentions.  Offer them extended free trials or affiliate commissions.
* **Goal:** Convert at least 200 signups from the waitlist and drive 300–400 new signups from public channels.

## Phase 4: Scaling & referrals (Days 71–90)

* **Referral program:** Implement a built‑in referral loop: users unlock additional summaries or features when they share their unique referral link.  Track referrals via Supabase or Stripe metadata.
* **Freemium conversion:** Monitor usage data to identify power users.  Send targeted upgrade emails (see upgrade email template) to convert them to Pro or Team plans.  Offer discounts to early subscribers.
* **Content marketing:** Publish case studies and how‑to guides demonstrating real‑world benefits (e.g., saving hours of note‑taking).  Share across LinkedIn, Twitter and niche communities.
* **Paid ads:** Test small‑budget ads on LinkedIn and TikTok using the scripts created earlier.  Optimise targeting to project managers, HR leaders, and remote teams.
* **Analytics & iteration:** Use GA4 or PostHog to analyse funnel metrics (visits → signups → activation → upgrade).  Identify drop‑offs and address them through UX improvements or onboarding emails.
* **Goal:** Reach 1 000 registered users by day 90 with at least 10% converting to paid plans.

## Metrics to track

* **Signups per channel:** Monitor which acquisition channels (Product Hunt, social, referrals) drive the most signups.
* **Activation rate:** Percentage of users who create at least one summary within the first week.
* **Retention:** Percentage of active users returning weekly.
* **Conversion rate:** Free → Pro/Team upgrades.
* **Referral rate:** Number of new users attributed to referrals.
